# Decision Making with Programming and Analytics Project
## Project Statement
Mike, CFO from New Ocean Trading, has long struggled to make sense out of the lengthy transactional records. The internal team who attempts to analyse the data often delivers outcomes that contradict with his anticipation. As such, he relies on his long-established business instinct to make business decision instead. Mike heard that you are good at analysing lengthy data and are well versed in Python Programming. He wishes to engage you to see what can be done to improve his department and understand the reason why the internal team may not be delivering what is expected. 

### He has brought with him 2 items for your analysis: 

 (1) The json file (cat_class.json) containing categorical classification information about their products, there are 8090 lines of stock internal serial number (StockISN) with its corresponding category codes. The following illustrates the first 10 lines of data. 
 
 (2) The second file (stockcards.xlsx) contains transactional records with more than 56000 lines of data covers the period from Jan 2011 to Apr 2019. The header information and first 10 records are shown below:
 
 1. Standardise and store all data into one consistent format (either csv/json/database/others) instead of the current forms of excel spreadsheet, json, and csv. Data transformation and conversion should be done programmatically instead of manually. Choose appropriate format and justify your decision.  
 2. Perform any appropriate cleaning activities to ensure that the data is accurate and consistent to be used for analysis. Remove irrelevant data that is not within the scope of this project. Make reasonable judgement to remove or replace data with suitable value. 
 3. Analyse the data appropriately to help with understanding customer buying patterns, geographical distribution of transactions, stocks item analysis and forecast. Mike would like to use these understanding to establish appropriate customer loyalty program, decide upon regional focus, and guide future stock up timing. Mike would like to see analysis based on the last 5 years of data. 
 4. Create a command line user interface which allows user to query data from stockcards data file. The query should allow user to extract information related to certain variable(s). The query results from data file are then displayed on the command prompt. The view option 
summarizes the data appropriate for reading, statistical summary could also be adopted to summarize the data. The program allows for viewing up to 5 yearsâ€™ data. You can decide on appropriate views that may be relevant to Mike.
